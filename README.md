# Benchmarking
Bridging Predictive Reliability and Explainability: A Multi-Representation Deep Learning Framework for Chemical Space Analysis of Immune Bioassays
# Overview
This repository provides a computational framework for predicting molecular bioactivity against specific biological targets using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) 
models. The framework supports multiple molecular representations, including descriptor-based, image-based, and graph-based inputs, and integrates explainability methods to 
improve the interpretability of predictions.
The primary objective is to enable reliable virtual screening of chemical libraries while maintaining scientific interpretability and reproducibility.

# Objectives of the Study
Predict active vs inactive molecules for specific bioassay targets.

Benchmark ML and DL architectures across multiple molecular representations.

Integrate explainability (e.g., Concept-based or feature attribution approaches).

Enable reproducible evaluation using standardized validation protocols.
